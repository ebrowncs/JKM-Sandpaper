# Analysis of Jonathan Katz-Moses Sandpaper Data
This is my own fiddling around with JKM's sandpaper data.  I posted it here mostly so I could share the data file in CSV format.  No affiliation with his YT channel, just to be clear.

Right now there is just some data and a chart or two but I will post the code and more charts.  I was curious to see if any of these different types of paper decay performance differently.  You can also see how much more effective the ceramic stuff is.  Interestingly, looking at each paper's performance at each time, you can see occasionally a paper does better later in the experiment.  Since the overall pattern is very clear and makes sense physically, these are probably just noise (common, unavoidable, random error).
