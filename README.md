# Analysis of Jonathan Katz-Moses Sandpaper Data
This is my own fiddling around with JKM's sandpaper data.  I posted it here mostly so I could share the data file in CSV format.  No affiliation with his YT channel, just to be clear. 

Right now there is just some data and a chart or two but I will post the code and more charts.
